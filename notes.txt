first randomize the overworld and dungeouns
then choose some sub-optimal routes for getting between cities and mark them for low danger areas (weak enemies or non-hostile) so that lowbies can walk between cities
then mark the other areas as higher danger areas
next we randomize the mod spawns for these areas according to the danger rating
then we can randomize skills/classes/items in the sql

seasonal server rotation? all players start in the same city?
